The structure of the frontend must comply with the following guidelines:

# Frontend Structure

Kotlin code of the frontend Android application is under `frontend/app/src/main/java/com/movieswipe`.

In this folder

- Organize the code by architectural layers into the following packages:

```
/app
├── /ui                             # UI layer that presents data and handles user interactions.
│      ├── /components    # UI elements shared between different features.
│      ├── /screens           # UI elements on the screen for each of the features.
│      ├── /viewmodels     # ViewModel classes that hold data, expose this data to the UI, and handle logic.
│      ├── /navigation       # Screen transitions.
│      └── /theme             # Theming files that define the app's visual design system including colors, typography, etc.
├── /data                        # Data layer responsible for data access, storage, and management.
│      ├── /local               # Data stored locally on the device (e.g., access token).
│      ├── /remote           # Data fetched remotely (e.g., backend API calls).
│      └── /repositories    # Data abstraction and a uniform interface to access data regardless of where it comes from (local database, remote API, cache, etc.)
├── /di                            # Hilt dependency injection modules that define how to create and provide dependencies
└── /utils                         # Common helpers, utilities, constants, and extension functions shared across the app.
```

- Inside `/screens`, `/viewmodels`, `/repositories` folders, organize files by the following domains: users, groups, voting, and movies.
