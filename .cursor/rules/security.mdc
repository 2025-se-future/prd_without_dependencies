The project implementation must comply with the following security guidelines:

- Use HTTPS for all communications.
- Protect all backend APIs with proper authentication and authorization.
- Validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Store sensitive configuration in environment variables instead of hardcoding them in code.
- Implement rate limiting on backend API endpoints and external APIs to prevent abuse.
- Follow the principle of least privilege for API access.
