The project tests must comply with the following testing guidelines:

- Follow test-driven development.
- Use descriptive and meaningful names. For test variables, use names like inputX, mockX, actualX, expectedX, etc. For test cases, use names that clearly describe the expected behavior.
- Implement proper error handling and logging in tests to provide clear failure messages.
- Write comprehensive API-level backend tests for each backend API.
- Write comprehensive end-to-end tests for each app feature.
